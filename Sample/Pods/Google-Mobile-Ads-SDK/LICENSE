(b)	If You commit a non-material breach of this License, You shall promptly provide written notice of the breach to Licensor using the contact information for Licensor identified on the Licensor Website and attempt to cure the non-material breach within 30 days.

(c)  Termination of Your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies of the Work or rights from You under this License prior to that termination.  
 
12. Miscellaneous. This License will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by and against, the permitted successors and transferees of the parties; provided that any such successor and/or transferee agrees, and by downloading or using the Work agrees, like all other licensees of the Work, to be bound by the terms of this OM License. This License will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that state, without reference to conflicts of laws provisions.  The parties hereby agree that the exclusive venue for any disputes hereunder will be in the state and federal courts in the City of New York in the State of New York, and the parties waive any objection based on inconvenient forum and/or all other choice of forum issues.  This License contains and constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior negotiations, agreements and understandings of the parties, whether written or oral.  If any term or provision of this License is determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, public policy or other reason, all other conditions and provisions of this License will nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable term or provision will be deemed replaced by a term or provision as determined by a court to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and to express the intention of the parties with respect to the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.  No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this License will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege unless such waiver is made in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the waiving party. A single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in this License will be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.  The parties are independent contractors, and this License does not create an agency, partnership, joint venture, or other legal entity.  There are no third-party beneficiaries to this License.
