# cocoapods-catalyst-support

## Requirements
* [Ruby 2.6.0+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

## Installation
```
$ gem install cocoapods-catalyst-support
```
**Note:** If you're using `cocoapods` action from `fastlane`, make sure to include `gem 'cocoapods-catalyst-support'` into your `Gemfile`. Don't forget to run `bundle install` after. For reference, see the [_Sample project_](https://github.com/fermoya/cocoapods-catalyst-support/tree/master/Sample).

## Usage

These are the steps to follow:
- Identify which pods don't compile for _macOS_ architectures.
- Follow [installation](#installation) instructions.
- Open your terminal and run `pod catalyst init` in your project folder.
- Configure your dependencies. Use `ios` or `macos` to make them available in one platform or the other:
```ruby
catalyst_configuration do
  ios 'Firebase/Analytics' # This dependency will only be available for iOS
  macos 'AppCenter/Analytics' # This dependency will only be available for macOS
end
```
- Run `pod catalyst validate` to validate your configuration
- Run `pod catalyst run` and configure your catalyst dependencies

That's it! Simple as that.

**Note:** Make sure to read the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) section to understand what this library does and what it doesn't.

## Commands

| **Command** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| `pod catalyst` | Short version of `pod catalyst run`  |
| `pod catalyst init` | Set up your Podfile to use `cocoapods-catalyst-support` |
| `pod catalyst run` | Configure your catalyst dependencies |
| `pod catalyst validate` | Validate your catalyst configuration |

**Note:** Make sure to run this commands in your project folder.

### Who is this for?

If you're using _CocoaPods_ and your App supports _macCatalyst_, you might have run into this error:
```
ld: in Pods/Crashlytics/iOS/Crashlytics.framework/Crashlytics(CLSInternalReport.o), building for Mac Catalyst, but linking in object file built for iOS Simulator, file 'Pods/Crashlytics/iOS/Crashlytics.framework/Crashlytics' for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```
or maybe
```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
    "_OBJC_CLASS_$_UIWebView", referenced from:
    objc-class-ref in BNCDeviceInfo.o
    objc-class-ref in BranchViewHandler.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```
Perhaps the error came from the App Store:
```
ERROR ITMS-90276: "Missing Bundle Identifier. The application bundle contains a tool or framework ${PRODUCT_NAME} [com.myapp.myapp.pkg/Payload/MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleSignIn.bundle] that is missing the bundle identifier in its Info.plist file."
```

This library is meant to solve this issue so that your project compiles as usual before supporting _macCatalyst_. Thus, you won't need to modify your current project structure.

Additionally, you might be thinking of using some libraries only for _macCatalyst_. This library takes care of that too and lets you configure which libraries will be linked for _macOS_ and which for _iOS_.

### What does this library NOT DO?

It doesn't "magically" fix the pod. If the pod isn't built for `sdk MacOS`, then there's nothing that will make it compile for this architecture but the pod's author supporting _macCatalyst_.

### What does this library DO?

It configures your pods project so that these "unsupported pods" are not linked when building for _macOS_ and will strip those frameworks from the final _Product_. You'll still need to use the precompiler to remove features from your _macCatalyst_ App:
```swift
#if canImport(ToInclude)
    // import iOS dependency
#endif
```
or
```swift
#if !targetEnvironment(macCatalyst) 
    // code to be excluded at compilation time from your macOS app
#endif
```
If you're using `Objective-C`:
```objc
#if __has_include(<ToExclude/ToExclude.h>)
    // import iOS dependency
#endif
```
or
```objc
#if !TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST
    // code to be excluded at compilation time from your macOS app
#endif
```

The advantage is you still get to use them for _iOS_ and _iPadOS_.

## Example

```ruby
require 'cocoapods-catalyst-support'

platform :ios, '12.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'Sample' do
  pod 'AppCenter/Analytics'
  pod 'Firebase/Analytics'
end

catalyst_configuration do
  verbose!

  ios 'Firebase/Analytics'
  macos 'AppCenter/Analytics'
end

post_install do |installer|
  installer.configure_catalyst
end
```

## Troubleshooting
* Make sure you're using the last version of the script.
* Add `verbose!` to your `catalyst_configuration` and check if the library is being excluded.
* Validate your `catalyst_configuration` by running `pod catalyst validate`.
* Open an issue and specify:
    * `cocoapods-catalyst-support` version
    * _Cocoapods_ version
    * _Xcode_ version
    * _Podfile_
